# OctoPrint-WebcamTab

This OctoPrint plugin moves the webcam stream from the controls into its own tab. Keyboard control is still possible and it is compatible with the [FullScreen Plugin](https://github.com/BillyBlaze/OctoPrint-FullScreen).

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:
